# Heart Attack Risk Checkup

## Problem Statement
Heart disease is a major global health concern, often undetected until severe symptoms arise. Many individuals lack an accessible tool for assessing their personal risk based on medical and lifestyle factors. This project aims to provide a simple, interactive way to estimate heart attack risk, promoting early awareness and proactive health choices .

## Scope of the Project
This Python console application guides users through a questionnaire about common heart health markers and habits. It calculates an estimated heart attack risk, categorizes the result, and saves the user’s responses for future analysis. The code also demonstrates data validation and CSV file handling—suitable for further development or educational use .

## Target Users
- Adults seeking to learn about their heart health risk.
- Health educators conducting preventative health workshops.
- Students or developers interested in Python basics, decision logic, and data storage.

## High-Level Features
- Step-by-step interactive questionnaire.
- Risk scoring and classification (Low, Moderate, High).
- Personalized feedback after assessment.
- Secure storage of each user’s data in a CSV file.
- Clear code structure for easy modification or extension.
